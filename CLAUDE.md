# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this is

`notenbuch.html` is a **single self-contained HTML file** — a German teacher's grade book ("Notenbuch"). All HTML, CSS, and vanilla JS (`"use strict"`, no frameworks) live inline in this one file. There is no build step, no package manager, no dependencies, and no tests.

To run it: open `notenbuch.html` in a browser (Chrome/Edge recommended for autosave — see persistence below), or via the hosted copy on GitHub Pages (`https://gehess-collab.github.io/notenbuch/notenbuch.html`) — useful on platforms like iPadOS where opening a local file in Safari doesn't reliably execute JavaScript. The hosted copy is the empty app shell only; grade data never leaves the local device. The whole UI is in German; keep all user-facing strings, comments, and identifiers in German to match the existing style.

## Persistence model

There is **no server and no localStorage for grade data**. All grade data lives in a user-chosen `.json` file on disk. The one exception is the light/dark theme preference (`localStorage["notenbuchTheme"]`, see `notenbuchThemeAufloesen()` in the `<head>` bootstrap script and `THEME_KEY`/`aktuellesTheme()`/`themeUmschalten()` further down): a pure UI setting, not grade data, so it deliberately lives in `localStorage` instead of the `.json` file and needs no `migriere()` step.

- **Chrome/Edge** use the File System Access API (`showOpenFilePicker`/`showSaveFilePicker`, gated by `hatFSA`). With a `fileHandle` open, `markiereAenderung()` autosaves via a 1.5s debounce timer directly back into the file.
- **Other browsers without File System Access** (Firefox, and notably iOS/iPadOS Safari, which does not implement this API and likely never will) fall back to a hidden `<input type=file>` for open. For save, `speichern()` tries the Web Share API first when the platform supports sharing files (`navigator.canShare({ files: [...] })` — true on iOS/iPadOS): this opens the native share sheet so the user can pick "Save to Files" and overwrite the existing file directly. If Web Share isn't available, or the user dismisses the share sheet with a real error (not a deliberate cancel), it falls back further to a plain download link. None of these fallback paths support autosave — every change needs an explicit tap/click on "Speichern".
- Optional **password protection**: `verschluesselung` (set via the 🔒 header button and `passwortDialog()`) wraps the saved JSON in an envelope (`{ notenbuchVerschluesselt: true, kdf, iterationen, salt, iv, ciphertext }`) encrypted client-side with AES-GCM, key derived via PBKDF2 from the user's password (`schluesselAbleiten`/`envelopeVerschluesseln`/`envelopeEntschluesseln`). There is no recovery — a forgotten password makes the file's contents permanently unrecoverable. `oeffnen()` detects the envelope and prompts via `entsperrenDialog()` before `migriere()` ever sees the plain state object.

`migriere(state)` runs on every load to upgrade older file formats to the current shape (e.g. synthesizing per-class `kategorien` from a legacy global `einstellungen.gewichte`). **When you change the persisted data shape, add a migration step here** so existing files keep working. Note this only concerns the shape of `state` itself — the encryption envelope is a separate outer layer that `oeffnen()`/`speichern()` handle before `state` is touched, so it needs no migration step of its own.

## Grading domain model (the core logic)

State is `{ version, klassen: [] }`. Each `klasse` has `schueler`, `leistungen`, `overrides`, and `kategorien`, plus a `notensystem` fixed at creation:

- `"note"` — Sek I, grades **1–6** (1 = best), quarter-grade steps, with a year grade.
- `"np"` — Kursstufe, **Notenpunkte 0–15** (15 = best), each half-year is its own final grade, **no** year grade.

The two systems invert direction (best grade is the min for `note`, the max for `np`), so grade math throughout branches on `system`/`notensystem`. `NP_BAND` maps 0–15 back onto the 1–6 color bands (`g1`–`g6`).

**Calculation chain (bottom-up):**
- `leistungsNote(l, sid)` — one student's grade on one Leistung, branching on `l.modus`: a directly-entered `note`; per-Teilaufgabe points (`vp`) summed and looked up in `l.schluessel` (`{note, minVP}` rows) via `noteAusSchluessel`; or (`modus: "diktat"`) an entered Fehleranzahl looked up in `l.schluessel` (`{note, maxFehler}` rows — inverted direction, fewer errors is better) via `noteAusFehlerschluessel`.
- `kategorieSchnitt(kl, sid, kategorie, hj)` — weighted mean of all Leistungen in a category, each Leistung weighted by its `gewicht` (a per-Leistung *Faktor*).
- `gesamtDezimal(kl, sid, hj)` — weighted mean across top-level categories by category `gewicht` (percent).
- `jahresDezimal` = `gesamtDezimal(..., null)` (whole year; `note` system only).

**Two critical rules that thread through the code:**
1. A missing entry (`leistungsNote` returns `null`) means "not planned for this student" and is **excluded**, never counted as 0. Preserve this.
2. **Category folding** (`kat.faltetZu`): a category can fold into another (e.g. "Test" or "GFS" counts toward "Klassenarbeit") instead of carrying its own weight. `kategorieVon(kl, id)` resolves a Leistung's type to its effective top-level category. Only categories that are `aktiv` and have no `faltetZu` contribute a percent weight; those weights are meant to sum to 100 (checked/shown in the Gewichtung view, but not enforced — missing categories are renormalized per student).

**Notenschlüssel** (points→grade thresholds) generators: `notenschluesselLinear`, `notenschluesselKnick` (two-segment interpolation with a bend at grade 4), and `notenschluesselKursstufeFix` (fixed 30-VP table). Thresholds are stored per-Leistung in `l.schluessel` and are hand-editable in the UI. For `modus: "diktat"` (Diktate, `note` system only), `notenschluesselDiktat(wortzahl, prozent4, prozent6)` generates an errors-based schluessel the same two-segment way (bend at grade 4), anchored at 0 Fehler for grade 1 and at the given percentages of `l.wortzahl` for grades 4 and 6 (`l.diktatAnker`).

**Overrides** (`kl.overrides[sid]`): teachers can manually pin a `hj1`/`hj2`/`jahr` grade, overriding the computed value. Borderline cases at x.5 (`istGrenzfall`) are flagged orange to invite an override.

## Rendering

Full re-render on every change — no virtual DOM, no diffing. `renderAll()` → `renderKlassenNav` + `renderViewNav` + `renderMain()`; `renderMain` dispatches on `aktiveView` (`uebersicht` | `leistungen` | `schueler` | `einstellungen`) or `offeneLeistung` (the grade-entry mask). Each `renderX` builds an HTML string via template literals, assigns `innerHTML`, then re-attaches event handlers by querying `data-*` attributes. Any state mutation should call `markiereAenderung()` (marks dirty + schedules autosave) and then re-render.

**Always pass user data through `escapeHtml()`** when interpolating into these template-literal strings — it's the only XSS guard. `csvEscape` is the separate escaper for CSV export.
